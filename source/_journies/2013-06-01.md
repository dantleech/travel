After leaving the campsite this morning I started immediately on the big climb of the day, an ascent to something like 2400m which took about 3 or so hours.

Upon reaching the snow-white top I descended almost immediately bracing myself for the cold. The weather was pretty dismal today, and it didn't improve as I hoped on the other side of the mountain. It wasn't raining hard, it was just cold and damp and the long descent slowly turned first my fingers and then my toes to ice.

I crossed the border into France. One benefit of being in France is that I have a french phone contract which gives me unlimied internet access and free international calls to landlines, so the first thing I did was check my emails followed by a phone call to my Dad. This was at about 3:00pm, I had not eaten for 7 hours since breakfast - the general cold climate and the task at hand (to get up the mountain) prevented me from stopping. So as I spoke to Dad my mind shifted to food and my shivering prompted me to put on more layers of clothes. My state of mind was quite high -- I think either the altitude or the descending, or just the sheer cold, makes me slightly euphoric.

This was the second highest mountain pass I have crossed in my life, the other was in Morocco at about 3000m.
