Finished Spanish lesson 23 despite being in France, why not carry on learning spanish?

Woke at 7am and it was raining outside and patting down gently on my tent and I could feel it was damp and I didn't really want to get up. So I made coffee and pondered staying put for a day. Which of course I didn't.

It was a good campsite with good views. Isolated and with a games room in which I could sit down in peace and quiet and do some work on the computer.

After leaving and climbing a large mountain pass the rain eased off and the scenery revealed itself to be really good. I cycled on towards the target campsite and arrived at about 4pm, but it was closed - abandoned is a better word - despite perfectly healthy signs advertising its presence.

I had to backtrack 6km to a previous campsite, which was basic, in a "thermal bath" town where people would come "for the water" I guess. Lots of people in wheelchairs.
