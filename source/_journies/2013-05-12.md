More spectacular views and was exhausted by the time I climbed the mountain, ice cold water from fountain at the top, looking south, the mountains. Two craggy rocky mountains in the foreground on each side and between them undulating distant purple ones.

An ancient monks sanitarium high up, inaccessibly high, overlooking everything. Long time out of use by the looks of it.

Looking north the mountains are gone, but bulging fields of olive trees spread out below. Each tree evenly spaced from its neighbor, a patchy quilt sea of olive field trees. Roll on into the distance. And the road descends through the city to meet them. Looked like easy hills from the top, but were deceptively steep, up and down, up and down.

The map on the phone is less useful in this region, sometimes the road I am on is not shown, and it shows no hotels or campsites when there are in fact hotels and campsites, and here even a Youth Hostel.

The youth hostel is one of the commercial types, expensive and un-trusting, and worst of all, overrun by a group of 14 year old school children. The WiFi is filtered (they have chosen to lock down the Wifi so can only surf the internet and cannot send emails or connect to IRC).

Am reassured that there are lots of places to stay to the North of here. My map doesn't any accomodations northwards for about 200km.
