Awake before 6am reading War and Peace (39% read). Left hotel at 8 40am in sleet and snow through a desolate Biarritz. A welcome and partial drying out café in St Jean-de-Luz. With the weather deteriorating Dan decided we should cycle just 8 miles further to border town of Hendaye and take train into Spain and pre-booked hotel at Deba (with 40 minute changeover at San Sebastian where we sought to stay warm by waiting room radiator). Arrived at Hotel Asia, an excellent 3 star hotel with view to sea and beach. Purchased headphones in local shop for 9 euros (two sets I brought with me had perished). Now only able to contact Debbie by e-mail as Dan’s phone contract is for use in France only. 24 miles.
