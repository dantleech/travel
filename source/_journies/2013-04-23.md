Slept badly last night, was itching and I had globs on my skin. Got up in the middle of the night and went to the bathroom to inspect myself so as not to wake the other people in the dormitory. In the end I just determined to not itch and to just stay calm until I fell asleep. In the morning the globs had gone.

Spoke to French girl this morning:

* Deux jours a Faro, deux jours a Lisbonne, deux jours a Porto, et comme ca on fais Portugal.

Crossed the river Guadiana into Spain, saying goodbye to Portugal.

Really knackered now. Have just been speaking with 2 italian guys who were smoking a joint outside of my room in the lounge and my Spanish is still extremely poor and they didn't speak any English, so explaining my journey to them was quite difficult, but aided by Google maps.
