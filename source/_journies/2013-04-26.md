Had make-yourself-breakfast, reading telephone, was shortly joined by Virgineia, my room mate. We talked in English for about 30 minutes, occasionally in french (although it was unnecessary, as her english was better than my french). She then left to meet up with the people she was travelling with.

I started packing my things and said goodbye to my other roommate, the Suede, and gave her my copy of "The Trial" by Franz Kafka, which I had just finished the night before.

Was a good day today, although I sinned a little by having both lunch and a not-so-insignificant coffee and cake break. Have eaten relatively moderately this evening to compensate.

Staying in a Pension (2 star) for a not-so-insignificant â‚¬25 with no breakfast. Camping was an option, but 5 kilometers away. Was also tempted by wild camping today, as I chanced upon a good spot, but reasoned that it was too early to stop. But should do camping again soon. Maybe I will set myself a camping destination for tomorrow.
