The last day of May. Need to be in Zurich in exactly 2 weeks.

Left campsite at around 11:30am after good nights sleep and CMF IRC meeting. The campsite people were very aimiable and I was allowed to use the out-of-season bar to work.

Bought some junk food from the supermarket, the usual rubbish - biscuits, chocolate, etc. I then took off down the main road, happily pedaling downhill, the minutes rolled by. I wonder where am going? I thought innocently and checked my GPS.

* Bollocks.

I was going the wrong way for 15 minutes, to make matters worse I had been going the wrong way *downhill*! This fairly offset my good mood to normal as I rode back to where I started to take the correct direction, which was an immediate mountain climb which would last for about 2 hours and was fantastic.

Had a nice long descent into the Urgell (?) before pedaling into Andorra. Andorra is a so-called "Principality" ruled by two "princes" one the bishop of the diocese of Urgell, the other the president of France, Fran√ßois Hollande.

Campsite was nothing to shout about, located just off the busy main road which runs the entire 60k of Andorra.
