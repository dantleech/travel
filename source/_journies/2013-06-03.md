France is so much more expensive than Spain. The village shop I stopped at was charging double the general prices in Spain, sometimes more. Which blows my ideal â‚¬4 a day budget out of the window.

Rolled out of the mountains, passed over 3 or 4 "Cols". The last two were so insignificant that I didn't expect them to be labeled.

Finally got into Narbonne, no youth hostels there or further down the road in Montpellier, so am going to stick to camping and see how far towards Zurich I can get in the next 2 weeks before maybe taking a short cut on the train.
