As I have headed further north the weather has been growing colder and wetter day by day. I was incredulous when my father told me it was like "winter" in England, but it turned out I only have to go 400k north to exchange baking heat with the cold.

It is 7 degrees in Madrid today, and 14 on the south coast. But of course rain and wind make the 7 degrees feel alot colder.

I left for Madrid this morning, the route was not straight forward, but one thing was for sure, I would have to pass through Toledo. It was wet and soon my hands were very cold - all my gloves were stolen in OPorto, so my hands were exposed to the elements, and were soon almost painfully cold and wet.

I arrived at Toledo after only an hour and a half. Toledo was an unexpected sight, it stands on a large island hill, surrounded it seems by a river or moat, and was once the capital of Spain - quite an historical city.

I had to buy some gloves, so made my way into town - as I did so it crossed my mind that there is probably a Youth Hostel or two in this touristic city. I have been very tired for the last couple of days and the thought of cheap repose appealed to me, that and the fact that I was shivering.

The Hostel I found was â‚¬14 for the night with breakfast (ed: 3 muffins and some soluble coffee powder).
