Blues night very straight-laced affair. One beer â‚¬4, an entire days food budget.

Zaragoza interesting city. Goya museum, free. Goya was born here. Lots of etchings, some disturbing, specifically:

Went for a 1h15 run up and down and around the length of the river as it crosses the city. Past the Expo 2008. Quite bizzare, massive buildings which at one time accomodated many thousands of people during the exhibition, created at what I guess was a very great expense. The the so called water tower, the bridge, a huge network of concrete buildings, all created for the Expo and now all empty and running down. The bridge is closed.
