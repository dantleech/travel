Start of another month. Ascended 15k to an altitude of 1100m, lots of cyclists flying past me down hill, and a few overtook me going up. Spectacular views and more to come as I go east I hope. My checkpoint is Granada.

Stopped after only 60k today, was feeling a bit run down after the morning climb, and wanted to get a camping stop in. So I am camping.

Really good campsite, by my criteria, there hardly anybody here accept me. The campsite is in the middle of nowhere and I can leave my stuff unattended whilst I use my laptop in the restaurant.
