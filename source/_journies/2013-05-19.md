First youth hostel shit, the second was not a hostel at all, the third was this one.

    6 bed dormitory
    Anniversary of the hostel.
    Free paella for everybody 
    First prize in raffle draw
    Means €20 refund for room
    Talking with group of young travellers
    and an older girl from Chile.
    Got very drunk, 
    2 bottles of red,
    2 pints, 2 cans.
    Irish pub in Madrid, O'Neils.
    Got very confused going to bed
    Lost things that were not lost, 3 in morning.
    €5 deposit for padlock required at checkin
    Lost the key for the padlock
    Key the size of my fingernail
    Had to break it open, no more deposit.

Left for a walking tour of Madrid with a small group and a tour guide from Glastonbury, a girl with dyed-purple hair and a south-west British accent. Very interesting and gave me an appetite for Spanish history even though my head was vibrating with alcohol fumes.
