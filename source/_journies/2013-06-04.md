So I left the hard grounded camping site. When I arrived there I had to pass up a very minor road, passing two prostitutes dancing in skimpy outfits. I left the very ordinary campsite in the morning and resumed the prosituted road, the N9. This is the second time I have ridden this route, and I keep getting deja-vu, but the real kind.

Last time it was raining and the wind was hard against me and I was in a fowl state of mind, this was 2 years ago. I remember also heading towards Beziers listening to "Cripled Black Pheonix" and I remember being very unimpressed and leaving immediately.

This time I was lucky enough to have the sun out and wind behind me.

Made my way to the coast, and did a nice offroad section for about 10k very fast.
