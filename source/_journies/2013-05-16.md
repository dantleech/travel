Now in the autonomous community of "Castilla-La Mancha". Which is strongly associated with the famous spanish novel "Don Quixote" by Cervantes, a book which I have never read.

After 40k today my legs felt like jelly and I felt K.O'd. The long seemingly unchanging highway passed under my feet and seconds felt like minutes and minutes like hours. No ernergy despite rather unecessary pizza for dinner and large breakfast this morning. Just wanted to sleep.

Decided to proactively search for a hotel after 70k and 4.5 hours. First was €25 sin desyuno, the second €28 also without breakfast, so I carried on. The next town had about 3 hotels - all of which were derelict. During this time I had not eaten anything.

Finally arrived in this industrial town, first Hotel was €25 without breakfast, the second €30 with breakfast, but managed to get it down to €25. Now quite exhausted.

Madrid tomorrow.
