Awake at 6 20am. Excellent breakfast. On a sunny day Dan (slightly sunburnt) decreed that we take a scenic route to Bordeaux via La Force. Stayed the night at Castillion la Bataille just 29 miles from Bordeaux. Started to watch 1954 classic film Sumari on laptop but fell asleep after hour or so. 58 miles.
