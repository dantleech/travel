So I left Nîmes after 2 rest days and doing lots of work. I was staying at the same Auberge de Jeunesse that I staued in over 2 years ago. It was here that I wrote my current website - www.dantleech.com - and where my job search in France started.

It was strange returning, everything was the same as I remembered it, the same staff. I left a book here the last time - a History of the Tour de France - which has since been taken away.

Mostly a rainy day today, I briefly visited Avignon, the City of the Popes. There are ramparts encircling the city (or at least the old city) and quite a large church building - the Palace of the Popes.

Lots of campings in this area as I head of the river Rhône towards Lyon.
