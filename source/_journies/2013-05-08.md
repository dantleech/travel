    I am Francisco Vázquez García 
    I am welcome to Almería 
    We have sin gas and con leche 
    We have fiesta and feria 
    We have the song of the Chochona 
    We have brandy and half corona 
    And leonardo and his accordione 
    And kalamari and macaroni 
    
    Come all you rambling boys of pleasure 
    And ladies of easy leisure 
    We must say adiós! until we see 
    Almería once again
    
    ...



(Fiesta, The Pougues)

In the morning I left the campsite, deciding to take the longer, scenic, route rather than the downhill option. I measured it as a 5k detour, it was more like 15k, but worth it. After a 1hr ascent I reached an altitude of 1700~m. Riding around the mountain before doubling back over a bridge onto the adjacent mountain and descending.

My map indicated 2 "Hostels" in the city of Almeria, I went to the first one, it was not a youth hostel as I had expected, but well, just a "hostel", otherwise known as a cheap hotel. They charged me €25 with no breakfast available - I should have left for the other place, which was a youth hostel for sure, but I was lazy, and I thought that it would be good to have some privacy.
