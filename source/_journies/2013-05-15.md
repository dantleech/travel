Right. Lets book a Hotel than shall we, lets see, about there? Somewhere between here and Madrid, looks about right.

Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. Tap, tap. tap, tap, tap. [+438], tap. CLICK.

Done, hmm, so how far is that then? 220k says google maps. Oh dear. Ah, wait, thats on the motorway, one moment - tap, tap, tap - thats better, 180k. Hmm..

In the end the distance was 163k, more or less or exactly 100 miles. Not the greatest distance I have ever done, but the longest on this journey and probably the longest with a bike weighing as much as this one.

After about 5 hours everything seemed self-samey, and the hours ticked by without me really noticing. It was a good day for it, cool, cloudy and sometimes rainy. There seemed to be the wind in front of me, though it was perhaps from the side, and may even have been helping me along as I cut a not-bad average pace.
