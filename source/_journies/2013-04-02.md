From Dads journal: Departed with Dan on first leg of his planned cycling trip around the world. Very cold day and took wrong turning in Southampton. Arrived wearily at Portsmouth terminal for 10pm crossing on “Normandie” at 6.45 pm. Shared bunk-bed cabin and hot chocolate but hardly any sleep. Cycling miles, 91.
