OK, so I seemed to have now passed out of the Sierra Nevadas, but all the same. Pretty uneventful day. I am heading to Almaria, which was too far to comfortably do in one day, and I couldn't find any alternative routes which featured a campsite or cheap hotel after 100k, so have stopped after only 50k at the only reasonable campsite option and should be able to make Almaria tomorrow.

Got here at about 14:00, and after putting my tent up have spent the time up to now working on the CMF. Not much else to report really, very easy day.
