Breakfast surprisingly good and plentiful. Left hotel at 8 45 am only to discover that Danâ€™s brake blocks were badly worn necessitating a visit to cycle shop opening up at 10 am. Eventually underway at 11 am via Sodupe on hilly inland route involving one 5 mile climb (and 5 mile freewheel descent) from Ramales de la Victoria to Arredondo and hotel in La Cavada with lovely mountain view.
