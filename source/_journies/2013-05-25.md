Currently in the city of Zaragoza. It was recommended to me buy a guy called Ian from Falmouth, with whom I had briefly spoken a few days ago at a campsite.

I was unsure as to if I wanted to go back to Biritz and do the Pyrenees, or to head towards Barcelona in the east. Ian mentioned Zaragoza and it sounded interesting, so this pushed my decision towards the east.

And now I am here, and need to think about where I am going next again, life is tough.

Now in a youth hostel. Blues band playing tonight at 22:00, am currently in the "comedor" typing on my laptop. One of the members of staff who is also a musician and playing here tonight, is fixing his guitar.
